# bliffoscope-problem
A solution to the **Bliffoscope problem** written in **Javascript** and **AngularJS**.

The application is pure *client-based* and the files are imported locally. 
Therefore, it needs to be opened through Firefox or in case of using Chrome by running:
`google-chrome --allow-file-access-from-files`

There are some example files in the `exampleData` folder in order to be able to test it. 

You can find the Bliffoscope problem definition inside the repository structure or visualise it directly through the app.
